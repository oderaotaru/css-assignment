    <h1 style="color:red">Welcome To CSS</h1>
    <p>So today, we have been given an assignment to practice our CSS. This paragraph should contain two hundred words (or more), so there's going to be just a little bit of babbling here.
        So far, it seems simple enough with a bit of research. Actually, a lot of research is required for a newbie like myself, but I've decided to make the best of it, seeing as even the
        most experienced developer still has to hit the research material ever so often. I guess that's what they mean by you never stop learning. I believe interest makes a whole lot of difference, though.
        When you're interested in what you're doing, even if it is just a little bit, it makes all the difference in the world. Putting in the work no longer seems like a difficult task, or like a chore.
        You just do it, because you're interested in finding things out. What happens if you touch this? Where did I make this mistake? Oh, that's what this button does. You dind things out because you're interested in knowing.
        I like to personalize things, by the way, so this is me documenting my thoughts as I go along. Alright, I should have hit two hundred words by now, hope you had an interesting read!
