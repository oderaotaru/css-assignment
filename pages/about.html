    <h1>This Is Our About Page</h1>
    <p>
        Our vision is not only to create information technology jobs and careers for people in transition and poverty but to facilitate
        economic and social opportunity for them and their families. The mission of Capacity Bay. Inc. is simple: build the capacity of U.S. Veterans, transitioning service members, New Americans, immigrants, refugees as well as others 
        living in areas of substantial unemployment.
